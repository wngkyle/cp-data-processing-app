### Overview

This project is a cross-platform desktop application designed to optimize the analysis and visualization of chip probing test data. By automating data processing, it enhances team productivity and significantly reduces the time required for engineers to process and interpret large batches of data.

### Features

 - Batch Data Processing: Streamlines the analysis of large data sets, reducing processing time from 2 hours to under 10 minutes per batch.
 - Customizable Parameters: Users can specify the data range, test parameters, and step size, allowing fine-grained control over data processing.
 - Automated Data Visualization: Generates insightful graphs and plots based on user-selected parameters, making complex data easy to interpret.
 - Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on both Windows and macOS, enabling seamless use across different systems in the lab.
